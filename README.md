# TECHstore - React online shop

Online shop created with React.js.

**deployed at:**

## Functionalities:

- clicking on any category in the home page will list all the products available;
- I simulated a data base for products using o json file and get them by asyncronous request;
- each product has its own product page;
- login page: you can login with Google or Facebook via Firebase;
- add/remove any product to/from Cart;
- add/remove any product to/from Favorites;
- cart and favorites icons have indicators that show you how many products you included; so you don't have to click on cart and favorites pages to see them.

## Technologies:

- React.js;
- React Router and dynamic routing;
- Redux for state management;
- Redux Thunk for asyncronous requests (Login);
- React Icons;
- Firebase for Logging;
- Bootstrap + custom CSS3.

**If you clone this repository, you need a Firebase account and use your own data for logging and run the app (+ rename the file firebase.template.js)**
